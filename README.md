🛡️ SOC Incident Reports Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on SOC incident reports created during blue team training and self-directed investigations.
Each report follows a real-world SOC workflow: alert triage, investigation, analysis, and remediation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to:

Analyze security alerts (SIEM / email / network)

Investigate incidents using threat intelligence tools

Apply MITRE ATT&CK methodology

Document findings clearly and professionally

Think like a SOC Analyst in real operational scenarios
